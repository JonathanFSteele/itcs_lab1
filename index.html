            My Home Town: Is Chaparral New Mexico

        <h3>Summary of Chaparral & El Paso:</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A small town on the outskirts of El Paso. And before you ask, Yes we are in the United States. My Family
            and I live in a comunity and assist our small town wherever we can. There is not much to do there other then
            a couple of family owned restraunts, a couple of convenience stores, gas stations, A Park, and schools. There
            are events that happen every once and a while, hosted by the school system, but most of our entertainment lies
            within El Paso.
            <br /> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In El Paso there are a lot more places to go to have fun. There is a Movie Theater, a grand
            variety of parks, restraunts, malls, game centers, book stores, etc... El Paso is one of the largest cities on
            the border between mexico and the United States there is alot of fun culture and entertaiment and plenty to do.
            One of my favorite places to go is the Fountains, which is an open mall on the east side of El Paso. I love our
            little town as its peaceful and quite quiet out there, but still not to far off from some fun activities in the
            large city over yonder.
